getMembers() may expose internal representation by returning 
  Registry.members 
May expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object 
Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the 
  object's fields exposes the internal representation of the object. If 
  instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the 
  mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, 
  you will need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the 
  object is better approach in many situations.

Comparison of String parameter using == or != in getMember(String) 
Comparison of String parameter using == or != 
This code compares a java.lang.String parameter for reference equality 
  using the == or != operators. Requiring callers to pass only String 
  constants or interned strings to a method is unnecessarily fragile, and 
  rarely leads to measurable performance gains. Consider using the 
  equals(Object) method instead.

Read of unwritten field 
The program is dereferencing a field that does not seem to ever have a

Nullcheck of input at line 126 of value previously dereferenced in 
  isNull(String) 
Nullcheck of value previously dereferenced 
A value is checked here to see whether it is null, but this value cannot be 
  null because it was previously dereferenced and if it were null a null 
  pointer exception would have occurred at the earlier dereference. 
  Essentially, this code and the previous dereference disagree as to 
  whether this value is allowed to be null. Either the check is redundant 
  or the previous dereference is erroneous.

Return value of model.Registry.getMember(String) ignored, but method has no 
  side effect 
Return value of method without side effect is ignored 
This code calls a method and ignores the return value. However our analysis 
  shows that the method (including its implementations in subclasses if 
  any) does not produce any effect other than return value. Thus this call 
  can be removed. 
 
We are trying to reduce the false positives as much as possible, but in 
  some cases this warning might be wrong. Common false-positive cases 
  include: 
 
- The method is designed to be overridden and produce a side effect in 
  other projects which are out of the scope of the analysis. 
 
- The method is called to trigger the class loading which may have a side 
  effect. 
 
- The method is called just to get some exception. 
 
If you feel that our assumption is incorrect, you can use a 
  @CheckReturnValue annotation to instruct SpotBugs that ignoring the 
  return value of this method is acceptable.

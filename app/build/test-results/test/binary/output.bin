fInvoking System.exit shuts down the entire Java virtual machine. This should only been done when it

-Nullcheck of value previously dereferenced 
bA value is checked here to see whether it is null, but this value cannot be null because it was 
d  previously dereferenced and if it were null a null pointer exception would have occurred at the 
d  earlier dereference. Essentially, this code and the previous dereference disagree as to whether 
c  this value is allowed to be null. Either the check is redundant or the previous dereference is 
  erroneous.

NMay expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object 
cReturning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the object's fields exposes the 
f  internal representation of the object. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked 
d  changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will 
b  need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the object is better approach in many 
  situations.

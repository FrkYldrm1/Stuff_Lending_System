byeBye() invokes System.exit(...), which shuts down the entire virtual machine 
Method invokes System.exit(...) 
Invoking System.exit shuts down the entire Java virtual machine. This should only been done when it 
  is appropriate. Such calls make it hard or impossible for your code to be invoked by other code. 
  Consider throwing a RuntimeException instead.

Nullcheck of input at line 218 of value previously dereferenced in check(String) 
Nullcheck of value previously dereferenced 
A value is checked here to see whether it is null, but this value cannot be null because it was 
  previously dereferenced and if it were null a null pointer exception would have occurred at the 
  earlier dereference. Essentially, this code and the previous dereference disagree as to whether 
  this value is allowed to be null. Either the check is redundant or the previous dereference is 
  erroneous.

getItem() may expose internal representation by returning Contract.item 
May expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object 
Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the object's fields exposes the 
  internal representation of the object. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked 
  changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will 
  need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the object is better approach in many 
  situations.
